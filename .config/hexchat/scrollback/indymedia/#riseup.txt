T 1598101834 -18ChanServ-	[#riseup] Hey, sorry but we don't give out invite codes here. To get such a code, you should get in touch with your local activist movement and get people to trust you and give you an invite. Spammers like to abuse our services. If you have a question, go ahead and ask, and try to stick around for as long as you can, we aren't all paying attention or awake!

T 1598102104 18*	nope_bot Sorry, you will not find an invite here. Though you may have no malicious intent, we cannot prove anyone who is who they say they are on the Internet. Because of this, we rely on our users to personally invite people they know. The best way to find yourself an invite is to get involved in activism. Inevitably, you will find Riseup users there.
